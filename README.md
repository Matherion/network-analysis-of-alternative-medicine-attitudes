# network-analysis-of-alternative-medicine-attitudes

This repository if linked to the Open Science Framework repository at https://osf.io/djkyf/. A rendered version of the main R Markdown file is normally available at [this GitHub HTML Preview service page](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/Matherion/network-analysis-of-alternative-medicine-attitudes/blob/master/scripts/network-analysis-of-alternative-medicine-attitudes.html).

Note that in that preview, the 'tabbed layout' that makes, for example, userfriendly inspection of the pairwise scatterplots possible, does not work (perhaps GitHub Preview blocks javascript?), so you may want to download the rendered .html in any case.
